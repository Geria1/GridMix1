## Details

The Renewable Energy Planning Database (REPD) tracks the progress of UK renewable electricity projects over 150kW through the planning system. It provides as accurate and comprehensive a snapshot as possible of projects, and of progress across the technology sectors, through the following stages:

- inception
- planning
- construction
- operation
- decommissioning

The database is updated during the month following the end of each quarter.

Please note: the minimum threshold for installed capacity was 1MW until 2021, at which point it was lowered to 150kW. This means that projects below 1MW that were going through planning system before 2021 may not be represented in the REPD.

### Interactive map

An [interactive map of the REPD data](https://data.barbour-abi.com/smart-map/repd/desnz/?type=repd) shows the geographical spread of renewable energy projects.

If the projects are not visible on the map, refresh your browser (press F5) and they should re-appear.

### Heat network projects

See the [equivalent database and map for heat network projects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heat-networks-pipelines).

### Contact us

Barbour ABI manages the data on behalf of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).

The data is sourced mostly from the web and developers. If you have information about a renewable energy scheme not included in this database, or you spot any inaccuracies in the information provided, please let us know by email to [REPD.enquiries@beis.gov.uk](mailto:REPD.enquiries@beis.gov.uk).
