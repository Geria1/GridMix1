🎯 Goal:
Create an integrated data visualization for the UK’s legally binding journey to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, including:

📈 Line chart showing actual and estimated emissions from 1990–2025, with blank space to 2050

⏳ Live countdown clock showing real-time time remaining until 31 December 2050

📊 Graph Requirements:
🔹 X-Axis:
Years from 1990 to 2050

Highlight: 1990, 2020, 2023, 2025, 2030, 2040, 2050 (target)

🔹 Y-Axis:
% of 1990 emissions (100% → 0%)

🔹 Line Data:
1990–2022: Actual emissions from official UK data (BEIS/CCC)

2023–2025: Estimated via Elexon BMRS API + emissions factors

2026–2050: Leave blank (no projected line), showing the remaining path as an open space

🔹 Design Elements:
Feature	Details
Solid line	From 1990 to 2025
Empty visual space	From 2026 to 2050 (to spark viewer imagination)
Labels & milestones	Annotations for 1990 (baseline), 2025 ("You Are Here"), 2050 (target)
Optional background fill	Subtle shading from 2025–2050 showing the path left to travel

⏳ Countdown Clock Specifications:
🔹 Function:
Live, real-time countdown to midnight, 31 December 2050

🔹 Placement:
Embed next to or above the chart, clearly visible to users

🔹 Format:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
🕒 Time Left to UK Net-Zero (2050):
24 years : 6 months : 3 days : 12 hours : 47 minutes : 10 seconds
🔹 Behavior:
Updates every second

On mobile: collapses to a smaller layout

Optional hover or info icon explaining:
“Countdown to UK’s net-zero climate target under the Climate Change Act.”

🔹 Technical Details:
Use JavaScript Date object for live countdown:

js
Copy
Edit
const targetDate = new Date("2050-12-31T23:59:59Z");
Countdown updates via setInterval() every 1,000ms

Fallback for no-JS: display static text (e.g., “Target Year: 2050”)

✅ Final Output Criteria:
Component	Requirement
Emissions Chart	Full timeline from 1990 to 2050, with data to 2025
Live Countdown Clock	Shows real-time time left to 2050 target
Responsive Layout	Works on desktop & mobile
Embed-ready Output	As HTML/JS module or React/Vue component
Visual Quality	Clean, modern design — suitable for GridMix site or public-facing dashboards
