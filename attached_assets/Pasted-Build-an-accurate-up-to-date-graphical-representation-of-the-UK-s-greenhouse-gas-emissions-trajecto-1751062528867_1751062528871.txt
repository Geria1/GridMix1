Build an accurate, up-to-date graphical representation of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions trajectory from 1990 to 2025, highlighting progress toward the legally binding net-zero target by 2050.

📡 Data Sources:
1. Primary: Official Emissions Data
Sources: BEIS, ONS, CCC (UK Government / Climate Change Committee)

Data: Historical GHG emissions in MtCO₂e or % of 1990 baseline

Focus: Verified emissions data up to the latest published year (likely 2022 or provisional 2023)

2. Secondary: Elexon BMRS Energy Generation Data
Endpoint:
https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/api/v1/generation/actual/per-type/day-total

Use BMRS data from 2023 to 2025 to estimate energy-sector emissions where official GHG data is unavailable.

Approach:

Use generation by fuel type (e.g., COAL, CCGT, BIOMASS) as proxies for emissions

Apply emissions intensity factors (kg CO₂e/MWh) to estimate annual emissions from energy generation

Example Emission Factors:

Fuel Type	Emissions Factor (kg CO₂e/MWh)
COAL	920
CCGT	394
BIOMASS	120 (biogenic, partially counted)
WIND/SOLAR/NUCLEAR	0 (assume zero)

📈 Graph Requirements
Type:
Line or area chart

X-Axis:
Years (1990–2050), with actual plotted values through 2025

Y-Axis:
% of 1990 emissions (baseline = 100%), down to 0% (net-zero)

Visual Elements:
Solid line for verified years (1990–2022)

Dashed line or shaded area for estimated years (2023–2025 using BMRS)

Green color gradient to represent emission decline

Markers on key years: 1990, 2020, 2023, 2025, 2030, 2050

Annotations for:

1990 Baseline

Net-zero target in 2050

Latest estimated emissions from BMRS-inferred data

🧠 Agent Tasks
1. Data Integration:
Merge official emissions data (1990–2022) with:

BMRS fuel-type generation totals (2023–2025)

Emissions proxies calculated from generation × emissions factor

2. Normalization:
Express all emissions values as % of 1990 baseline

Clearly indicate which values are official, and which are inferred

3. Visualization Output:
Clean, professional chart with title:
"UK GHG Emissions Pathway to 2050: Including 2025 Estimates via Energy Generation"

Formats:

Dashboard embed (HTML/JS or iframe)

Downloadable PNG/SVG

Include legend, axis labels, and tooltip data

✅ Completion Criteria:
Visual is complete through 2025 (not just 2022)

Incorporates and clearly distinguishes BMRS-derived data

Reflects actual and estimated progress against the 2050 target

Ready for policy presentation, web publishing, or energy system briefings
