🌱 3. Emissions Trajectory Section
Components:
📉 Line chart from 1990–2025, with empty space to 2050

🔴 1990 baseline

🟢 Current emissions marker (e.g., “43% of 1990 levels”)

🏁 Net-zero target at 2050

Clock:
"⏳ Time Left to Net-Zero (2050): 24 years, 6 months, 3 days..."

🧠 4. Analysis & Insights Panels (Optional)
