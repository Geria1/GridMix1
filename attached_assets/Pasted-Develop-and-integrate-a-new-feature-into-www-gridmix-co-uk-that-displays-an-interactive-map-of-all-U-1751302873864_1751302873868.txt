Develop and integrate a new feature into www.gridmix.co.uk that displays an interactive map of all UK renewable energy projects with a capacity of 150kW and above, using the Renewable Energy Planning Database (REPD). The map must be searchable, clickable, and auto-updating quarterly to reflect new REPD releases.
Data Source
Primary Dataset: Renewable Energy Planning Database (REPD) Monthly Extract – CSV/XLS format.


Update Frequency: Quarterly.


Supplementary Datasets (Optional, for enrichment):


BEIS datasets (e.g., local authority renewable statistics)


Ofgem project-level datasets


UK Companies House API (for developer info)


ONS postcode and boundary data for mapping and searching.



Feature Overview
1. Interactive UK Map
Use a mapping library such as Leaflet.js, Mapbox, or Google Maps API.


Only display projects with Installed Capacity ≥ 150 kW.


Cluster or density map if zoomed out; individual project pins when zoomed in.


2. Project Details on Click
When a user clicks on a map marker, show a modal or sidebar with:
Project Name


Installed Capacity (MW)


Developer Name


Technology Type (e.g., Wind Onshore, Solar PV)


Development Status (e.g., Application Submitted, Under Construction)


Full Address


Postcode (searchable)


Coordinates (Lat/Lng)


Planning Authority


(Optional Enrichment) Estimated commissioning date, CO₂ savings, local employment impact


3. Search & Filter Options
Text search: by project name, developer, postcode.


Filters:


Technology Type (checkboxes or dropdown)


Status


Region or Planning Authority


Capacity range (slider)


4. Automated Data Updates
Programmatically check the REPD URL for new releases quarterly (e.g., using scheduled GitHub Actions, server-side cron jobs, or an ETL pipeline).


On update:


Parse and clean the data.


Apply filters (≥150kW).


Update the map and dataset used by the web app (via JSON or a backend DB).


5. Design Integration
Maintain consistency with GridMix UI/UX design.


Ideally place this feature on a new tab/page: /projects or /map.


Mobile responsive, clean interface with fast load time.



🧠 Intelligence Layer (Optional Enhancements)
Use machine learning or external APIs to:


Predict commissioning likelihood or timeline based on status and historical data.


Estimate CO₂ emissions saved per project.


Aggregate local economic impacts (e.g., local jobs created).


Identify stalled or inactive projects.



⚙️ Technical Notes
Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js, if needed.


Database: Store processed REPD dataset (e.g., in PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial queries).


Frontend: Use React, Vue, or static HTML+JS based on current stack.


Hosting: Must integrate smoothly with current GridMix deployment (likely on Replit or GCP).


Performance: Use lazy loading or pagination if the dataset is large.
