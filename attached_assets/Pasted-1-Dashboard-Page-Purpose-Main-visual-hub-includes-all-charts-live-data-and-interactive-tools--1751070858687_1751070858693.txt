🔹 Section: Powering Transparency in the UK Energy Transition

GridMix is your live window into the UK’s evolving electricity system. Built to track the real-time and historical performance of the national grid, GridMix offers a clear view of how power is generated, consumed, and decarbonized.

From offshore wind in Scotland to solar farms across England, we break down how each energy source contributes to the grid — by the hour, week, and season. Whether you're a policymaker, researcher, or curious citizen, GridMix helps you follow the UK's journey to net-zero by 2050 with clarity and confidence.

Where the Data Comes From — and Why It Matters
 GridMix uses official datasets from Elexon’s BMRS API, the UK's central platform for real-time electricity market information. We process and visualize this data to show:
How much electricity is generated by each source (wind, gas, nuclear, etc.)


When and where energy production shifts


Trends over days, weeks, months, and years

🔹 Header: About Me

Hi, I'm John Igwebuike, the creator of GridMix.

I'm passionate about clean energy, open data, and building tools that help people understand how our grid is changing. GridMix was born out of my interest in climate policy, data visualization, and empowering users with transparent, timely information about the UK's energy system.I work in project management in the UK renewable energy sector and have interest in property investments,and entrepreneurship.

Tools I’ve used: Built on Replit with the help of ChatGPT, using live data from the Elexon BMRS and Carbon Intensity APIs

Goal: To make energy data not just accessible — but understandable and actionable.
