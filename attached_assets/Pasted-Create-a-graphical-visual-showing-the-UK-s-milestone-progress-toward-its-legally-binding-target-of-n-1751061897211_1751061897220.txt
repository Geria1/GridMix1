Create a graphical visual showing the UK's milestone progress toward its legally binding target of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, using 1990 GHG levels as the baseline.

📊 Visual Requirements:
1. Graph Type:
A line chart or stepped area chart showing GHG emissions over time (1990–2050).

2. X-Axis:
Years (from 1990 to 2050)

Key milestone years labeled:

1990 (baseline)

2010

2020

2025

2030

2040

2050 (target year)

3. Y-Axis:
Total UK GHG emissions (in MtCO₂e – million tonnes CO₂ equivalent)

100% corresponds to 1990 levels

0% represents net-zero

4. Data Points (illustrative — AI agent should retrieve latest values if live data integration is available):
Year	Estimated Emissions (vs 1990)
1990	100%
2010	~75%
2020	~59%
2023	~50%
2030	(Target) ~32–35%
2050	0% (Net-Zero Target)

5. Design Features:
Highlight 1990 baseline and 2050 target with annotations.

Use a green trajectory line showing emissions reduction.

Use milestone markers (dots or flags) at major target years (e.g., 2023, 2030, 2040, 2050).

Optional: shaded area to represent the "carbon budget" or allowable emissions pathway.

📌 Caption / Title:
“UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions Pathway: Progress Toward Net-Zero by 2050”

🧠 AI Agent Tasks:
Data Handling:

Use official emissions datasets (e.g., BEIS, CCC, ONS) where available.

Normalize emissions to % of 1990 baseline for clarity.

Chart Generation:

Render the line chart using consistent, professional styling.

Export in web-friendly format (SVG/PNG) or embed in dashboard.

Annotations:

Add text to explain:

1990 baseline (e.g., “~800 MtCO₂e”)

Current progress (e.g., “~50% reduction by 2023”)

Net-zero definition (GHG emissions = 0, with offsets included)

Optional Enhancements:

Add historical policy milestones (e.g., Climate Change Act 2008, Net Zero Commitment 2019)

Display renewable share growth alongside if relevant

✅ Completion Criteria:
Clear, accurate, and readable chart generated

Milestone progress from 1990 to 2050 clearly depicted

Visual can be used in public dashboard or briefing materials
