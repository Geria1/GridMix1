Feature: Carbon Intensity Forecasting (Short-term & Long-term)

 Add a new section to https://www.gridmix.co.uk that displays a 72-hour carbon intensity forecast for the UK electricity grid, with confidence bands and smart energy timing advice. The system should update automatically every few hours.
Backend Tasks (Python)
Set up a data pipeline that fetches:


Historical carbon intensity from Carbon Intensity API


National Grid ESO demand forecast (from their data portal)


Weather data (wind speed, irradiance – use OpenWeatherMap or similar)


Train a forecasting model using Prophet:


Input: historical carbon intensity, time of day, day of week, weather, and demand forecast


Output: carbon intensity prediction for every hour in the next 72 hours


Include confidence intervals (upper & lower bound)


Expose an API endpoint:


GET /api/carbon-forecast


Returns JSON: { timestamp, forecast, upper, lower }[]


Set up a background job or cron (Replit-compatible):


Auto-refresh forecast every 6 hours


Store latest predictions in a local file (JSON) or in memory



 Frontend Tasks (HTML/CSS/JS or React)
Add a new section or page: /forecast or tab: "Carbon Forecast"


Build a line chart with forecast data:


Use Chart.js or Highcharts (already works in Replit)


Line = forecast


Shaded area = confidence band


Tooltip: show timestamp + forecast + range


Smart summary text above chart:


Calculate the cleanest 3-hour block (lowest forecast average)


Example:


 “⚡ The cleanest hours to use electricity in the next 24h: 1am–4am (avg. 82gCO₂/kWh)”



Make the component responsive for mobile.


Extra (Optional) Features
Add a toggle to compare today vs. tomorrow


Add a small history chart to compare forecast vs actual (data is available from the same API)


Offer downloadable CSV of forecast


File Structure Suggestion on Replit
bash
CopyEdit
/main.py                # Flask or FastAPI app
/forecast_model.py      # Python model using Prophet
/static/js/forecast.js  # Chart rendering logic
/templates/forecast.html # Page layout
/data/forecast.json     # Cached forecast output


Tips for Replit Agent
Use replit.tasks or asyncio for periodic background forecasting jobs


Store the latest forecast in memory or as a .json file


If using Flask, serve the HTML template and include the chart via <script src="static/js/forecast.js">



Final Goal
GridMix should now display a real-time forecast of carbon intensity across the next 72 hours, with visual guidance on when to use energy cleanly. It should refresh predictions every 6 hours automatically, and present users with actionable, beautifully visualised insights.
