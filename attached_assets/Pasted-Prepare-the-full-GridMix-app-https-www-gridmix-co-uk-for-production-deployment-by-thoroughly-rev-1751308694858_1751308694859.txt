Prepare the full GridMix app (https://www.gridmix.co.uk) for production deployment by thoroughly reviewing and upgrading all systems — backend, frontend, data pipelines, models, APIs, and UI — to ensure performance, security, maintainability, and reliability.

✅ TASKS FOR THE AI AGENT

⸻

🧪 1. Codebase Review & Refactoring
	•	Remove all unused imports, functions, test code, or legacy assets
	•	Refactor repetitive code into clean, modular functions
	•	Enforce naming conventions and consistent file structure
	•	Verify .env or config variables are used properly (e.g., API keys, secrets)

⸻

🔐 2. Security Hardening
	•	Sanitize all external data inputs (e.g., query parameters, search fields)
	•	Remove hardcoded credentials; use Replit secrets manager or environment variables
	•	Secure API endpoints (limit rate, validate input)
	•	Prevent directory traversal or unauthorized file access
	•	Hide internal debug info and stack traces in production

⸻

🔄 3. Data Pipeline & Forecast Model Validation
	•	Ensure automated carbon intensity forecast model:
	•	Runs every 6 hours
	•	Produces accurate, recent output
	•	Stores forecast JSON reliably
	•	Validate weather/demand/carbon forecast data ingestion works even if APIs are delayed
	•	Add fallback logic or cache if external API is temporarily unavailable

⸻

📦 4. API & Backend Stability
	•	Ensure all backend endpoints (e.g., /api/carbon-forecast) return correct, typed JSON
	•	Implement basic error handling (500s, timeouts, validation)
	•	Minimize backend response time (<500ms where possible)
	•	Cache heavy API responses if needed

⸻

🌐 5. Frontend Quality Check
	•	Ensure responsive design (works well on mobile, tablet, desktop)
	•	Optimize asset loading (minify CSS/JS, lazy-load charts/data)
	•	Fix layout or rendering issues in all major browsers
	•	Use alt text for images and accessible markup where needed

⸻

📊 6. Charting & Forecast UI Test
	•	Ensure carbon forecast chart:
	•	Loads reliably on every page refresh
	•	Displays shaded confidence bands correctly
	•	Highlights clean energy hours
	•	Make sure tooltip and forecast summary text are accurate

⸻

📈 7. Performance Optimisation
	•	Check page load time (target <2s)
	•	Bundle or minify JS/CSS
	•	Reduce unnecessary API calls or duplicate renders

⸻

🛠️ 8. Deployment Readiness
	•	Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all requests
	•	Set a custom domain (www.gridmix.co.uk) with SSL/TLS active
	•	Configure uptime monitor (optional: use UptimeRobot or similar)
	•	Set up error logging (basic logging in Replit console is fine)
	•	Enable email alerting for forecast job failures (optional)

⸻

🧾 9. Final User Acceptance
	•	Generate a “Release Checklist” or changelog
	•	Run through full user journey:
	•	Load app
	•	Browse energy dashboard
	•	Use map
	•	View carbon forecast
	•	Try a search or filter
	•	Get final test feedback from a friend or beta user

⸻

✅ Deliverables from this Prompt
	•	A fully tested and production-ready GridMix app
	•	All scripts and tasks running smoothly (especially forecast jobs)
	•	Clean codebase and secured deployment
	•	Confidence that the app is resilient, informative, and user-friendly
